# Cryptography

Long integer arithmetic is implemented:
1) Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with the remainder, raising to a natural degree
2) Comparison of numbers (<,>, =)
3) The same operations (except comparison) for a given module
4) Finding [√x], where [x] denotes an integer part x ∈ Z
5) Solving first-order comparison systems
• The digit number is not limited to a predefined program
the upper border.

Using the module of long arithmetic, the basic algorithms of cryptography and number theory are implemented:
1) Pollard's Po-algorithm for factorizing long integers
2) Algorithm "Baby-step giant-step" finding a discrete logarithm
3) Calculation of Euler and Möbius functions
4) Calculation of Legendre and Jacobi symbols
5) Chippole's algorithm for finding a discrete square root
6) Miller–Rabin primality test
7) El-Gamal cryptosystem.
